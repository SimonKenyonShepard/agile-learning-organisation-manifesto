# agile-learning-organisation-manifesto

## Introduction

This document started out as an email discussing what a traditional English school would look like if it were based on a holocracy/agile approach rather than the currect status quo. By establishing it in a global source control repository we can treat it more like a communal blueprint encompassing more people's views and beliefs. if we all don't agree indivually we can fork it and modify it in the way we want, those changes can then be merged back into the mainline if we see they are benificial for the whole.

## A day in the life of a learner at an agile learning organistaion

every morning the students would come together at 9am and do a stand up for 15m. They discuss what they learned yesterday, what impediments they were facing and what they would do today. They would also have some kind of kanban board for the week where they participate in moving cards through swim lanes showing their levels of proficiency at various topics.

After this they split off into pairs and in one hour blocks that they planned and they study different topics. A certain number of topics would be mandatory and a certain number of blocks left open for them to pick what to learn. To study various topics say design they would move off to the design room where there would be a design coach who could help them out and advise if needed.

In  weekly governance meetings the students and coaches would get together to discuss new topics and roles and responsiilities. In weekly tactical meetings they would discuss troubles with different topics. In weekly planning meetings circles would plan their agendas for the next week.
